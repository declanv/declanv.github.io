description1: "A three-year-long project that required hundreds of meetings with almost every academic and administrative department at SVA, this was quite an undertaking. Designing a flagship site for an art and design school meant style was paramount, and we knew we'd be held to pixel perfection by our discerning community."
description2: "Our small team designed every template and detail of the site- both for the public-facing front-end as well as the custom CMS, which the entire SVA community uses to craft high-quality content. The design process was very much a team effort, but I was largely responsible for the parts of the site that require registration, which are also some of the biggest breadwinners for the school: the Continuing Education, Pre-College, Summer Housing, and Destinations programs."
description3: "Over the course of the project, we alternated between designing and prototyping the front-end and engineering the CMS, which we conceived and built from scratch."
description4: "Since the web team at Visual Arts Press was only a few strong, we enlisted the help of a crack web team based in Romania to implement the CMS and front end of sva.edu. The team was terrific, but outsourcing development meant taking on far more of a project management role than I ever had previously. I comprehensively documented business rules, use-cases, and bug reports in novel-length wiki pages and Gitlab tickets, alongside my many other web development tasks."
objective: "To boldly refresh the public face of one of NYC's leading art education institutions"
