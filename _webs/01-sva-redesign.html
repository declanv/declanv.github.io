description1: "A three-year-long project that required hundreds of meetings with almost every academic and administrative department at SVA, this was quite an undertaking. Designing a flagship site for an art and design school meant style was paramount, and we knew we'd be held to pixel perfection by our discerning community. <br>Check out <a href='https://sva.edu/features/new-year-new-website-introducing-sva-edu'>the SVA Feature story</a> about the project."
description2: "Our small team designed every template and detail of the site- both for the public-facing front-end as well as the custom CMS, which the entire SVA community uses to craft high-quality content."
description3: "The design process was very much a team effort, but I was largely responsible for the parts of the site that require registration, which are also some of the biggest breadwinners for the school: the Continuing Education, Pre-College, Summer Housing, and Destinations programs."
description4: "Over the course of the project, we alternated between designing and prototyping the front-end and engineering the CMS, which we conceived and built from scratch."
description5: "Our team was small, so we enlisted a crack web team based in Romania to implement the CMS and front end of sva.edu. The team was terrific, but my day-to-day evolved to include far more project management. I comprehensively documented business rules, use-cases, and bug reports in novel-length wiki pages and Gitlab tickets, alongside my many other web development tasks."
description6: "Our team set out to design and develop a site that was accessible to all. As such, we used plugins in Sketch to check color contrast as we designed, and consulted with a third-party to ensure our implementations were fully accessible for screen-reader software."
objective: "To boldly refresh the public face of one of NYC's leading art education institutions"
