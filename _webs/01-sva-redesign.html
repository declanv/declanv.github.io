description1: "A three-year-long project requiring hundreds of meetings with almost every academic and administrative department at SVA, this was quite an undertaking. Designing a flagship site for an art and design school meant style was paramount, and we knew we'd be held to pixel perfection by our discerning community. <br>Check out <a href='https://sva.edu/features/new-year-new-website-introducing-sva-edu'>the SVA Feature story</a> or <a href='https://www.printmag.com/post/sva-website-relaunch'>Steve Heller's PRINT Magazine article</a> about the project."
description2: "Our tiny team designed and prototyped every template and detail of the site, both for the public-facing front end, and the custom, built-from-scratch CMS, which the SVA community uses to craft high-quality content."
description3: "The design process was a huge team effort, but I crafted user flows and designed layouts for the most complex, registration-oriented sections, like Continuing Education, Pre-College, Summer Housing, and the Destinations programs."
description4: "We designed the site using humble tools like pencil and gridded paper as well as complex Sketch libraries, user flows, Framer prototypes, and animation tests like the one above."
description5: "We enlisted a crack web team based in Romania, so my role grew to include lots of project management: comprehensively documenting business rules, use-cases, and bug reports in novel-length wiki pages and Gitlab tickets, alongside many other web development tasks."
description5: "We designed and developed a site accessible to all. We used plugins in Sketch to check color contrast as we designed, and consulted experts to ensure our implementations are fully accessible for screen-reader users."
objective: "To boldly refresh the public face of one of NYC's leading art education institutions."
