objective: To design and engineer an intuitive tool for delivering bulletproof, responsive, and stylish messages to SVA's wide audience of students, alumni, faculty, and influencers.
intro-description: "Email is suprisingly hard to design and build for. There are so many combinations of email clients and devices to consider, and many clients (like Gmail) aggressively remove CSS, JS, video, and anything fancy. The challenge was to design a system that cranks out reliable, table-based html that looks great in everybody's inbox."
