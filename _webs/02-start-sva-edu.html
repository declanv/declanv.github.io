description1: "SVA has traditionally mailed out a beautiful but very expensive printed view book catalog to prospective undergraduate students. The goal was to design and develop an exciting digital distillation of the printed book the Admissions team could email to its mailing list or point prospective students to at college fairs. I helped ideate on this project from the very beginningâ€“ helping set a narrative direction and designing many of the details along the way."
description3: "We worked early on to convert the print materials into a scrollable format that captured the spirit of the print edition. I contributed illustration to help visualize during this brainstorming phase."
description4: "This was a very collaborative process, but I helped design the department picker section which allows users to browse departments, as well as the form that our conversion process hinged on."
description5: "We enlisted a crack web team based in Romania, so my role grew to include lots of project management: comprehensively documenting business rules, use-cases, and bug reports in novel-length wiki pages and Gitlab tickets, alongside many other web development tasks."
description5: "We hoped to reach high school seniors shopping for art schools, so we drove traffic to the microsite from social media advertising."
objective: "To dazzle hard-to-convince prospective art students with our stylish but succinct microsite, and ultimately add them to our mailing list."
