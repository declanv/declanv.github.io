description1: "We were tasked with distilling the spirit of SVAâ€™s beautiful printed undergraduate catalog into an exciting digital experience for prospective students. I helped establish a narrative direction for the project and contributed concepts, design, development, and project-management."
description2: "We devised a rich, scroll-to-animate experience conveying the vitality and key benefits of our undergraduate experience. We strove for performant CSS and JavaScript animations, and consulted with <a href='https://www.levelaccess.com/'>Level Access</a> to ensure our designs and implementations were accessible."
description3: "We drew key inspiration from the printed catalog, like a limited palette to help unify the design. I contributed illustration to help visualize during the early brainstorming and sketching phase."
description4: "Our design process was iterative and collaborative but I designed the department picker section which allows users to browse departments, and the form on which our conversion process hinged."
description5: "We knew much of our demographic target could be found on social media, so we tailored Instagram ads to drive traffic to our experience."
objective: "To dazzle hard-to-impress prospective art students with a stylish and succinct microsite, and ultimately add them to our mailing list."
