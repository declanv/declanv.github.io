intro-description: "Designing a flagship site for an art and design school meant style was paramount, and we knew we'd be held to pixel perfection by our discerning community. This project required hundreds of meetings with almost every academic and administrative department at SVA. It was quite an undertaking. <br>Check out <a href='https://sva.edu/features/new-year-new-website-introducing-sva-edu'>the SVA Feature story</a> or <a href='https://www.printmag.com/post/sva-website-relaunch'>Steve Heller's PRINT Magazine article</a> about the project."
description5: "We enlisted a crack web team based in Romania, so my role grew to include lots of project management: comprehensively documenting business rules, use-cases, and bug reports in novel-length wiki pages and Gitlab tickets, alongside many other web development tasks."
objective: "To boldly refresh the public face of one of NYC's leading art education institutions."

    description: "One of the great perks of working for an art school is that we have many (mostly) willing user testing subjects in classes across the street. We conducted multiple usability tests with our target demographic: Pre-College and Freshman students, which provided invaluable data for design revisions."

    description: "I played a central role developing our design system and workflow. We built an organized system based on a central, shared Sketch library full of nested symbols and namespaced text styles so we designers could efficiently build new page designs."
