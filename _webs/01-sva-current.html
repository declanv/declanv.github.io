description1: "The School of Visual Arts is one of NYC's leading art schools. I maintained the flagship institutional site, along with multiple small-scale projects for various departments and school events."
description2: "I was almost exclusively responsible for the Continuing Education domain at SVA, which is the largest revenue driver for the institution after tuition."
description3: "I was responsible for helping design and implement some of the newer and most successful features on sva.edu, like the 'Features' blog, which allowed departments to highlight student, faculty, and alumni news."
description4: "SVA's themed Annual Party was a treat all of the faculty and staff looked forward to. To get everyone excited, our team put together an on-theme invitation website, which interfaced with our RSVP system. I helped design and implement the annual party site for four years."
objective: "To highlight the vast and diverse network at SVA through interfaces that highlight student, alumni, and faculty work and news."
