description1: "Relay Graduate School of Education is an institution dedicated to the education of our nation’s most important and least appreciated professions: teaching. I worked on all of Relay’s applications, including their flagship site. I also helped develop Relay’s (now sadly defunct) learning management system, for which I spearheaded a React.js approach."
